USER INTERFACE
==============    

Map will be a matrix/multidimensional array (an int **) holding an int value for the status of that particular X and Y on the map, for example:

[ 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]
[ 0 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ]
[ 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ]
[ 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 ]
[ 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]

the 0 represents a spot that can be moved into
the 1 represents a spot that can't be moved into
and the 2 represents either an item, or enemy or something like that

Another idea is a 0 represents a blocked area, and > 0 is an open block available for a move, but the int value
increase in probability that an enemy fight will occur.. so for example:

[ 1 2 3 0 0 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 ]
[ 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 ]
[ 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 0 0 ]
[ 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 ]
[ 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
[ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]

if they walk over a 1, it's a 25% chance they fight an enemy,
if they walk over a 2 it goes up to say, 50%
a 3 is 75%
and so on... (also taking into account fight possibilities below)

A heads up display, or side status area will be visible to let user know of their stats, and items they hold


Fight possibilities
===================
During each move, a method on the map is run that will calculate a probability based on factors, ie:

   for each time a move is made that doesn't result in an enemy fight, we increment a variable that will increase probability
